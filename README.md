# PUSH SWAP

The task at hand is the Push Swap project, which presents a straightforward algorithmic challenge. 
The objective is to devise a program, named push_swap in C, that efficiently sorts a collection of integer values. 
This program leverages two stacks and a set of predefined instructions to manipulate these stacks. 
The ultimate aim is to generate and showcase the most concise sequence of Push Swap language instructions, 
displayed on the standard output, to achieve the sorting of the provided integers.

## How to use (Linux)

Navigate to the root folder of Push Swap in your terminal.
Run the make command to compile your Push Swap program.
Run ./push_swap 3 2 1 27 in your terminal.
